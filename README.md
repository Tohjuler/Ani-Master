## ⚡General Information
This project was started because I was tired of having to use the public websites.
There are some that is fine, but you almost always have to deal with ads and popups.
Also, you needed a VPN for security and privacy.
So I started to look for a website I could self-host, but there was none good enough.
<br>
So I decided to make my own.


### 🥅The Goal
- [ ] A website that is easy to use.
- [ ] A website that is easy to self-host.
- [ ] A website that is easy to maintain.
- [ ] A website that is easy to update.
- [ ] A place where there is everything you need.
